### Usage
Just clone/fork this repo and tweak it to your needs. You probably want to make changes in ```_config.yml``` and ```_sass/variables.scss```, as well as change social links (```_includes/socials```).

To make tags work, you need to add separate file in ```tag/``` - just mimic the existing files, and remember that you must do this every time you use a new tag in your post.
